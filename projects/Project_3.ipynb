    "\n",
    "In this project a Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to model neutrons passing through different materials which could potentially be used to shield from radiation. This simulation only took into account thermal neutrons and did not consider that neutrons lose momentum as they scatter within a material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the simulation had been created the path of a neutron was shown through each material showing the various scattering events. Then the simulation was run for many neutrons incident on 10 cm slabs of each material. A stacked bar chart was produced showing that water transmitted the smallest percentage of neutrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the number of incident neutrons was varied to study the percentage error in each measurement to find the optimal number of simulations. It was found that increasing the number of incident neutrons reduces the percentage error. However, after about 500 neutrons the change in the error due to the change in the number of simulated neutrons became much smaller. To keep the run time of the notebook low, a small number of neutrons have been simulated with results for larger simulations quoted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic length of each material was found by fitting a line to the thickness and a logarithm of the number of transmitted neutrons. The characteristic lengths were found to be: about 2 cm for water, 10 cm for lead and 20 cm for graphite. However, checking the results of the simulation at multiples of the characteristic length showed that the materials transmitted fewer neutrons, suggesting that the characteristic lengths are underestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation using multiple layers of material was attempted; however, it was found that none of the neutrons could cross the boundary, implying that there is a problem in the algorithm."
